# Fashion Zone Folder Organization Guidelines

## Current Structure Analysis

The Fashion Zone project follows a well-organized React/TypeScript structure with clear separation of concerns:

- **Components**: Organized by feature and responsibility (UI, admin, feature-specific)
- **Pages**: Organized by routes with admin pages in a separate subdirectory
- **Hooks**: Follow the `use-` prefix convention
- **Store**: Contains state management files
- **Types**: Contains TypeScript type definitions
- **Utils**: Contains utility functions

## Recommendations for Consistent Organization

### 1. Feature-Based Organization

For new features, maintain the current pattern of organizing related components together:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── feature-name/       # Group components by feature
│   │   ├── ComponentOne.tsx
│   │   └── ComponentTwo.tsx
```

### 2. Complete the Contexts Directory

The `contexts` directory is currently empty. Add React context providers here:

```
src/contexts/
├── AuthContext.tsx        # Authentication context
├── CartContext.tsx        # Shopping cart context
├── ThemeContext.tsx       # Theme/appearance context
```

### 3. Consistent Naming Conventions

Maintain these naming patterns:

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `ProductCard.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `use-products.ts`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `utils.ts`)
- **Context**: PascalCase with `Context` suffix (e.g., `AuthContext.tsx`)

### 4. Organize Admin Features

Continue the pattern of separating admin functionality:

```
src/
├── components/admin/      # Admin components
├── pages/admin/           # Admin pages
```

### 5. Group Related Functionality

For new features that span multiple directories, maintain consistent naming:

```
src/
├── components/feature-name/
├── hooks/use-feature-name.ts
├── pages/FeatureName.tsx
├── store/FeatureNameStore.ts
```

### 6. API and Service Organization

Consider adding a services directory for API calls and external integrations:

```
src/
├── services/              # API and external service integrations
│   ├── api.ts             # Base API configuration
│   ├── products-service.ts # Product-specific API calls
│   └── auth-service.ts    # Authentication service
```

### 7. Assets Organization

Organize assets by type:

```
src/
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── icons/
│   └── styles/
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Maintain Existing Structure**: The current organization is solid - continue following the established patterns
2. **Add Missing Directories**: Consider adding the suggested directories as needed (services, assets)
3. **Document Standards**: Use this document alongside PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md to maintain consistency
4. **Review Periodically**: As the project grows, periodically review the organization to ensure it remains effective

By following these guidelines, the Fashion Zone project will maintain a consistent, scalable, and maintainable folder structure that aligns with the current approach.
